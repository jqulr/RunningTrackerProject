# My Personal Project: Running Log

## A Tool for Tracking Running Progress

This is an application that enables users to track their running 
progress by logging information such as distance, duration, average pace,
heart rate and the type of run they did on different days. Users could set running goals for upcoming days
and mark activities as complete when they finish each run. Additionally, one could
include special notes regarding their running activity on that day. At the end of the week
or month, one would be able to view a list of their running activities along with
information such as the total running distance, number of different types of runs and 
the number of goals achieved. This project is of interest to me because I would like to see an overview of my 
running progress and be able to set different goals during training.
